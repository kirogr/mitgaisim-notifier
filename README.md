# Mitgaisim Notifier
Mitgiaisim Notifier is a simple script that connects to the Mitgaisim API (אפליקציית מתגייסים) and keeps track of changes in a malshab profile.

It automatically sends a notification when there is a change in the profile.

- A new case is opened or closed
- Status changes in an existing case
- Changes in the quality scores (dapar, profile, interview, kahas, etc.)
- Changes in personal details (phone, email, recruitment date, etc.)

Everything runs in the background and you will be notified when there is a change.
